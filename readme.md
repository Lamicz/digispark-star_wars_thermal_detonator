Board is permanently connected to battery and top switch is another I/O pin - only to trigger animation - easier to make mechanically (no need to be permanently connected).
INPUT_PULLUP means that I/O pin is HIGH (5V) and via trigger is connected to ground, so if you activate the trigger, it is grounded (LOW).
